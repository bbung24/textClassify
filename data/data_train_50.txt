the sign in front of the steepled church read sunday sermon does god prefer particular sports teams a man passing by gives the sign a befuddled look the scene is in fact a cartoon in the current new yorker but the question is a good one since it has more or less been in the news the guy checking out the sign might very well have been aware of the strange one hesitates to say celestial sports goings on in new york and chicago in recent weeks in fact supernatural and miracle win were among the encomiums not infrequently used regarding certain yankee postseason triumphs the same has been true for the bears in three of the bears last four games they have won in stunning fashion on sunday they were leading 27 24 near the end when tampa bay 's 49 yard field goal attempt hit the right upright bears win earlier the bears won two straight against san francisco and cleveland by rallying to tie the game in the fourth quarter and win it in overtime against the 49ers mike brown intercepted a pass in overtime and ran it in for the victory against cleveland same guy did it again why the bears atop the their division with a 7 2 mark why now we 've gotten some breaks said the head coach dick jauron who was 11 21 in his first two seasons there 's no doubt the ball 's bounced our way more than it has the last two seasons hmm yes now no one is quite sure what reason might be behind a greater power looking especially kindly on chicago and the bears new york however was a different story after the tragic events on sept 11 it was said that the yankees spectacular grit raised the city 's spirit it began with the yankees coming back from two games down against oakland in the division series with a phenomenal play by derek jeter but one the yankees actually practiced saving the yankees from what might have been a series ending loss the yankees stormed back to win the next two games and the series and as a reminder to those fans who happened to be standing in line on broadway for cancellations for the producers and missed all the action the yankees down by two games to one to arizona in the world series won two straight games in suspiciously similar fashion trailing with two outs in the ninth inning of game 4 the yankees tied the score on a two run homer and another homer in the 10th won it in game 5 same thing behind with two outs in the ninth and a two run homer tied the game the yankees then won it in the 12th the yankees alas lost the series to essentially a better diamondbacks team but the free agent period in which players could begin signing yesterday reminds us that miracles have had less to do with the yankee success in recent years than with their good free agent picks mike mussina and david wells for two and good trades such as those for roger clemens tino martinez and scott brosius as well as a farm system that produced the likes of jeter andy pettitte and bernie williams the arizona miracles rested primarily in the left and right arms of randy johnson and curt schilling the bears like the yankees have added important free agents this season signing ted washington at 380 pounds and keith traylor at 340 to erect a virtual wall on the defensive line their top two draft picks running back anthony thomas and receiver david terrell have each had substantial impact and some of our other players are maturing and the players absolutely do n't give up said bill mcgrane director of administration for the bears what about deific intervention there 's an old russian proverb he said it goes 'pray devoutly hammer stoutly religion has often played a part in sports including pregame prayers the rev edward a malloy president of notre dame said if both sides are praying who is god paying attention to it 's like it has more to do with our sense of preparation and dependency rather than legitimately expecting god is going to favor one side over the other bernardo harris a packer linebacker had said it another way before his team 's game against the bears two weeks ago he said he could n't be bothered with talk about the bears being a miracle team we 're worried about hitting people in the mouth making big plays and winning games he said the packers then performed a miracle of their own they beat the bears suddenly and stunningly earthly

to the editor being texan i took great interest in of barbecue and men by brent staples the city life july 31 my 10 gallon hat goes off to mr staples for his dedication to the grill but that 's not why i wrote no i 'm afraid i have a much more serious concern mr staples was on the mark until he made the egregious and unfortunately all too common mistake of discussing barbecue sauce barbecue sauce despite its name has no place in barbecue the proof is evident if you have a perfectly grilled piece of meat the addition of sauce can only diminish it now i know this issue is debatable but being texan i do n't really need to justify my beliefs to anyone but my pappy so do not defile your barbecue with so called barbecue sauce your taste buds will thank you and your texan friends will shake your hand with a new enthusiasm ashley williams falls church va july 31 2003
representative richard a gephardt 's push to win the endorsement of the afl cio which is important to his hopes of winning the democratic presidential nomination has been set back by his problems raising money and his low standing in some polls many union leaders say mr gephardt of missouri has far more individual union endorsements than any of the other eight democratic candidates but to win the labor federation 's endorsement he needs the backing of unions representing two thirds of its 13 million members two thirds is a very tough and high mountain to climb said gerald w mcentee chairman of the afl cio 's political committee and president of the american federation of state county and municipal employees my own judgment is that right now he does n't have two thirds can he reach the two thirds it 's a possibility but i think it 's very challenging and difficult securing the afl cio 's endorsement before the primaries could give mr gephardt a major leg up political experts say because it would place at his disposal hundreds of union campaign workers already assigned to congressional districts across the nation all nine democratic presidential candidates are scheduled to debate tuesday in chicago before the afl cio 's executive council the council will not consider an endorsement this week federation officials say but mr gephardt 's backers hope that he can win the group 's endorsement at a meeting in october he very much would like the afl cio endorsement said steven elmendorf a senior adviser to the gephardt campaign even if we do n't get the endorsement a majority of unions will endorse gephardt he added there 's zero chance that any other candidate is going to get endorsed by the afl many union leaders question whether mr gephardt can obtain the needed two thirds majority hurting his chances several union presidents say is that three of the nation 's largest and most politically active unions the state county and municipal employees the service employees international union and the american federation of teachers appear unlikely to endorse mr gephardt any time soon the state county and municipal employees are leaning toward senator john kerry of massachusetts while the service employees and teachers say they are not ready to decide because they are still polling their members those unions represent nearly a third of the afl cio 's membership nine unions including the international association of machinists and aerospace workers the international union of bricklayers and allied craftworkers and the seafarers international union have already endorsed mr gephardt the unions that have endorsed him represented slightly more than one million members and then mr gephardt received a highly important endorsement friday when the executive board of the teamsters union which has 14 million members voted to support him bret caldwell the teamsters communications director said the union 's president james p hoffa would officially announce the endorsement in detroit next saturday mr hoffa will fly with mr gephardt to iowa the site of the first caucus and new hampshire the site of the first primary to speak on mr gephardt 's behalf a longtime union political official who insisted on anonymity said from the beginning there have been two schools of thought in the labor movement the gephardt loyalists and the pragmatists the pragmatists have been asking the question from the beginning can he win there is a reluctance some of them are pulling back a little bit certainly the money thing did n't help only two candidates have ever received the federation 's endorsement before the primaries vice president al gore in 2000 and walter mondale then a former vice president in 1984 when the decision was made to endorse gore who was a sitting vice president with him facing just one challenger it was still very tough to get to two thirds said steve rosenthal the afl cio 's former political director among union leaders there is a consensus that mr gephardt has the best record on labor issues that is one reason so many union leaders were concerned about his lackluster fund raising he raised just 38 million in the second quarter talking about mr gephardt 's fund raising bruce s raynor president of the union of needletrades industrial and textile employees said i would be less concerned about that than the question of the ability of a candidate to defeat george bush working families need george bush to be defeated we need a viable candidate to do that
congress 's main budget adviser has looked years into the future and concluded that the nation can not afford its overheated present as republicans continue cutting taxes enriching spending and rolling ever larger debts a decade over the horizon fiscal autopilot is not an option warned douglas holtz eakin director of the congressional budget office in a no nonsense estimate of serial budget imbalances to come unless the deficit and tax cut happy congress begins to put the brakes on now future americans will most likely be caught in an impossible crunch of historically higher taxes and plummeting health care and retirement benefits mr holtz eakin concluded in his forecast the cost of social security medicare and medicaid inevitably must eat up a sharply increasing chunk of the nation 's economic output as baby boomers retire and people live longer said mr holtz eakin a former bush adviser they will face more expensive health care with fewer active workers to help pay the escalating costs he said with short term economic indicators finally on the rebound no incumbent republican is likely to applaud these warnings they are about problems that will effectively reach a crisis beyond the careers of the very politicians who are most responsible for them but world markets in which the dollar is steadily declining against the euro are already showing a deepening suspicion about president bush 's policy of budgeting by deficit and debt congress should heed mr holtz eakin 's message that moving sooner is better than moving later
to the editor we should applaud leon botstein 's statement that the federal government has an important part to play in our overly localized system of public education op ed sept 19 but he misses the point that president clinton senator joseph i lieberman and others associated with the democratic leadership council have been trying to make new democrats would argue that a strong federal role can be combined with decentralized administration and local authority there are many ways the federal government can exercise leadership without trying to determine everything that goes on in the schools so let 's try to think anew without being limited by outmoded ideas about government philip selznick berkeley calif sept 19 2000 the writer is professor emeritus of law and sociology at the university of california at berkeley
to the editor regarding the article last sunday about the dobbs ferry village government 's barring nonresidents from parking at its metro north station commuter parking is a problem not only in ardsley and dobbs ferry but in most of westchester county i believe that this parking problem highlights the need for governments to require developers to submit transportation impact statements when proposing to build condominiums co ops or other housing the transportation impact statement should include provisions for shuttle bus or van service from the housing complex to a train or bus station if every new complex would offer residents transportation to a train or bus station we could avoid creating additional traffic congestion and metro north parking problems paul feiner town supervisor greenburgh
anna lindh who died early yesterday at the age of 46 after a stabbing attack was one of sweden 's most popular politicians a lifelong member of the governing social democrats she had been mentioned as a future party leader in 1998 when she became foreign minister under prime minister goran persson the swedish press called her persson 's crown princess seeing her as his likely successor she was vehemently pro european in a country where joining the european union was a heated issue she became the leading campaigner in the government 's drive to persuade a somewhat skeptical electorate to replace the swedish crown with the euro at the time of her death stockholm and indeed much of the country was plastered with posters picturing her under the word ja signifying the yes vote she favored in the referendum set for this weekend ms lindh supported the same causes embraced by swedish social democrats including environmental protection and human rights but she was unusually outspoken earlier this year during sweden 's six month presidency of the european union she called president bush a lone ranger for his decision to go to war in iraq without united nations approval although she expressed support for his campaign against global terror she clashed with the bush administration over other issues as well like its refusal to take part in the formation of the international criminal court she roundly criticized prime minister silvio berlusconi of italy for comparing a german lawmaker to a nazi concentration camp kapo and in an october 2001 interview with the times of india she succinctly laid out her government 's stance on the middle east insisting that israel remove settlements on the west bank withdraw military forces from the west bank and gaza strip anna maria lindh was born in stockholm on june 19 1957 and earned a law degree from the university of uppsala she was elected to parliament in 1982 and quickly rose through her party 's ranks becoming chairman of its youth league in 1984 and a member of the policy making executive committee in 1991 when the social democrats regained power in 1994 she was named environment minister she is survived by her husband bo holmberg also a politician and by their two sons david and filip

the national football league is pondering meeting with two lawyers who seek increases in head coaching opportunities for african americans the nfl received a letter from the lawyers late thursday night the letter was addressed to the commissioner but he was out of town a league official requesting anonymity said it is being reviewed we will respond sometime next week and it is possible that if the commissioner does not meet with them he will appoint someone in the league office to do so it could be the first step to avoid litigation on a sensitive and explosive issue for african american coaches the league 's management and its owners and players the lawyers johnnie cochran and cyrus mehri released a report last week called black coaches in the nfl superior performance inferior opportunities the report was developed by the labor economist janice madden from the university of pennsylvania and is supported by richard lapchick the race and sports authority and floyd keith executive director of the black coaches association among numerous findings the report said that african americans in the nfl were the last hired as head coaches and the first fired and that too few of them were involved in the interview process greg aiello the nfl 's vice president for public relations said the league had developed creative ways to address these issues realized their importance and welcomed constructive dialogue cochran said these numbers showed the need for substantive change before the nfl 's next head coaching hiring cycle which usually begins in january since 1920 the league has hired more than 400 head coaches and 6 of them 15 percent have been african american of the last 22 head coaching hires 2 have been african american and though african american players compose nearly 70 percent of the league the coordinators jobs are 72 percent white and 28 percent african american and the head coaching jobs are 94 percent white compared with 6 percent african american the league currently has 32 teams and two black head coaches cochran and mehri said they were not interested in quotas but specifically in the league 's interviewing more african americans for these vacancies they want commissioner paul tagliabue to use draft picks as a reward or penalty not only to provide incentive for owners to interview and hire more african american head coaches but also to diversify club front offices with more members of minority groups including women and hispanics aiello said that in the last five years nfl teams had interviewed 15 african americans for head coaching jobs a total of 23 times and 3 became head coaches they need a game plan for change because what they are doing is not working cochran said in the last three years it has gone backward not forward some of these owners have exhibited a mentality that they are not going to change unless you have a carrot stick concept tie this issue into draft picks and you will see results aiello said the league believed that because more african american assistant coaches are in the league than ever from that pool african american head coaches will emerge in 1980 he said the league had 14 black coaches in 1997 it had 103 with 5 of them coordinators and 3 of them head coaches it now has 154 and 12 are coordinators he said that from the league 's minority coaching internship program conducted during training camp 50 participants now have jobs as nfl coaches and one herman edwards is a head coach with the jets mehri said that the way the nfl states its position on the issue sounds similar to that of texaco and coca cola corporations against whom mehri won major race discrimination suits totaling nearly 368 million the nfl has been struggling with this issue regarding african american coaches over the years mehri said i 've been fighting for african americans in the corporate ranks where they have to fight hard to go half as far as their white counterparts when you see a denny green fired after the record he has built and then not get a new job or marvin lewis coach the best defense ever win a super bowl and two years later not have a head job you know that something is wrong the nfl is part of the epicenter of this country when kids today see so few african american head coaches what does that tell them the fans are being cheated a lot of african american coaches are better qualified than some of the people currently holding the job and our data shows that in a league where 70 percent of the players are african american someday those players are going to retire what does that mean to them when an option important to many of them is shut down you 've got one african american general manager in this league ozzie newsome in baltimore let 's empower the commissioner and create change or let the courts decide mehri said first mehri and cochran would like to help the league develop a plan that works otherwise apparently a suit will be filed in federal court in new york the nfl is not above the law mehri said but there is some arrogance there art modell the baltimore ravens owner said that if he listened to cochran he 'd have o j simpson coaching my team modell added we have a system in this league and color is not a factor this is such a competitive business and we want to get the one guy coaching our teams who can turn the juice on regardless of his color and i have a question since allie sherman coached the giants in the 60 's why have n't there been any jewish head coaches in the league what 's the difference this is like the middle linebackers the centers the coordinators and the quarterbacks in our league there are more african americans in those positions now and the wall has been brought down there are n't many african american coaches in the colleges right now but we 've had some growth in the numbers of our assistant coaches and coordinators it 's coming if it goes to court they 'll lose cochran responded why should these coaches have to wait why is it that a guy like sherman lewis experienced and successful sees one of the guys that used to report to him on the minnesota staff mike tice get a head coaching job in minnesota before he does there is a major glass ceiling and we want to negotiate a plan that creates constructive change before we litigate but we are prepared to litigate and we have the stamina resources and commitment to see this through
if a last minute provision in the senate farm bill becomes law irradiated hamburger could become known by a more appealing name pasteurized beef senator tom harkin the iowa democrat who heads the senate agriculture committee said today that he had inserted the provision in an effort to more clearly define pasteurization the process by which disease producing bacteria have long been destroyed in some foods through heating the harkin change would define irradiation as a kind of pasteurization it has been sought for several years by the growing irradiated food industry which argues that irradiation is a cold pasteurization and deserves to be referred to as such but neither the food and drug administration nor the agriculture department has yet to agree that meat treated by radiation a process approved by the government two years ago should qualify as pasteurized food safety advocates argue that the legislative provision is an effort to avoid fda regulatory procedures that would ordinarily be needed in order to define irradiation as a form of pasteurization for labeling purposes both the industry and mr harkin deny any such end run mr harkin 's home state is also home in sioux city to the main plant of the surebeam corporation the no 1 irradiator of ground beef sold in the united states he inserted the provision almost three weeks ago on the last day of senate debate on the farm bill the provision was later discovered by the public interest lobby public citizen in another late change mr harkin also inserted a clause that would forbid the agriculture secretary to keep irradiated food out of the school lunch program or any other federal nutrition program only the senate version of the bill includes those provisions the legislation is now in a house senate conference and it is uncertain whether the clauses will survive the two sides in the food safety debate agree that when consumers see irradiation on a label they often view it as a warning that the product has undergone a potentially dangerous process irradiation is something the consumer associates with wartime and bombs and bad things said diane toops food and trend editor of food processing a trade magazine that views irradiation favorably and since sept 11 the process has become associated with anthrax as well because irradiation is now used to kill germs in the postal system while mr harkin played down the effect of his last minute changes consumer advocates said the provision on irradiation 's definition could allow irradiated food to be labeled pasteurized without fda action under current regulations the label on irradiated meat must instead state that it has been treated by irradiation and must be marked with the symbol for irradiation called a radura it would be terrible just horrible misleading the public about what industry is doing to its food said joan claybrook president of public citizen wil williams spokesman for the surebeam corporation said that senator harkin was simply coming up with one standard definition and that surebeam had no intention of skirting the regulatory process irradiation is pasteurization partial sterilization to eliminate pathogens mr williams said all the farm bill does is come up with a standard everyone can use since irradiation was approved by the government two years ago he said it has been used to remove germs from millions of pounds of beef a spokesman for agriculture secretary ann m veneman had no comment on the harkin provisions

for those who pay attention to such things there is change afoot at the indian point nuclear plants correction make that the indian point energy center in the process of taking over the plants the entergy corporation has been replacing the nuclear part of the name with the more generic some might say more innocuous energy center a sign with the new title went up last fall outside the main entrance of the plants which are in buchanan about 35 miles north of midtown manhattan and in the past month the name has surfaced in a series of newspaper and radio advertisements intended to reassure the public about the safety of indian point 's nuclear operations in one recent newspaper ad for instance readers were urged to take confidence in the security of indian point energy center jim steets a spokesman for entergy said the name change reflected the company 's plan to eventually add a gas turbine to the site and to integrate what had been two separate nuclear plant operations under different owners entergy bought indian point 3 from the new york power authority in 2000 and indian point 2 from consolidated edison in september it was an important message to our employees that we were one site one team he said it was really about the integration of the sites rather than coming up with a name that was more palatable but some critics say that entergy is trying to downplay its nuclear operations in reaction to widespread concerns over safety since the sept 11 terror attacks corporations like to find ways to explain to people that castor oil is really honey said state assemblyman richard l brodsky this is the kind of thing that general electric tried to do with pcb 's in the hudson mr steets has denied any such motive calling the criticisms naive and overly suspicious indian point only means one thing to anyone who 's been involved or lived in westchester he said it was n't like we were trying to fool them into thinking we were a solar generated plant indian point is not the only nuclear plant seeking a makeover the millstone nuclear power station in waterford conn recently shortened its name to millstone power station while washington nuclear project 2 near richland wash was rechristened the columbia generating station among the other plants without a nuclear in sight is the susquehanna steam electric station near berwick pa it 's not unusual not to have nuclear in the name said diane screnci a spokeswoman for the federal nuclear regulatory commission but in the commission 's records at least the official name of the indian point plants remains the indian point nuclear generating unit 2 and unit 3 in the end of course a name change is just that a nuclear plant by any other name is still a nuclear plant harry di pietro 65 a storeowner in buchanan who supports nuclear energy said he would continue to call it just indian point i know what it is whatever they call it he said it does n't really matter what 's in a name anyway
ariel meyerowitz 580 broadway at prince street soho through jan 27 dr harold edgerton 's stop action photographs including the famous milk drop coronet remain enduring icons of modern experience yet why the world of art embraced edgerton 's originally purely scientific work is still a question worth pondering superficially this exhibition 's mostly small black and white vintage prints from 1935 to 1979 are simply informative records of events that happen too quickly for the naked eye to register you can see how all the muscles and tendons of a boxer 's arm stand out at the moment his fist hits the stationary bag you can study hummingbirds an owl or a bat arrested in mid flight as well as a popping balloon that has a wide open gash yet remains tautly inflated pictures that cumulatively record motion preserve the graceful trajectory of an athlete 's golf or squash swing or a pole vaulter 's leap from the perspective of art the appeal of edgerton 's images is in their perfectly composed lucidity and their surrealistic fusion of the factual and the miraculous the milk drop coronet the image of a glowing white crownlike form on a red field seen here in one of just two existing 1957 c prints made from the original negative is an uncannily beautiful image like the motion studies of eadweard muybridge in which the gridded repetition of the human figure suggests a metaphor about the subjection of humanity to technology edgerton 's images have acquired an emblematic aspect they have become symbols of a world in which the real is determined more and more by what machines rather than humans can perceive ken johnson

though the number of tuberculosis cases in the united states has fallen to an all time low a panel of experts called yesterday for renewed efforts to prevent the disease including screening immigrants for the dormant form of tb and tripling the financing for tuberculosis research there were just 17528 cases of active tuberculosis disease reported in the united states last year down from 18361 cases in 1998 and fully a third less than the recent peak of 26673 set in 1992 still according to a report from the institute of medicine of the national academies because tuberculosis remains widespread in many parts of the world the current decline in the united states could easily reverse us policy makers can not afford to relax their vigilance morton n swartz a professor at harvard medical school said dr swartz the chairman of the committee that wrote the report added that current efforts at tb control will not be sufficient and doing less could be disastrous the committee warned against a replay of the 1970 's when declining tb rates led to a dismantling of prevention and treatment programs a decade later in the late 1980 's tb infection rates rose again with drug resistant strains emerging part of the difficulty in eradicating tuberculosis is that the airborne bacteria that cause it can lie inactive in a person 's lungs for years with the host entirely unaware of the infection an estimated 90 percent of people infected by the bacteria never develop the active form of the disease which can cause a persistent cough chest pain fatigue and fever the report urges new efforts at detecting latent tuberculosis infections particularly among immigrants though immigrants account for only 10 percent of the united states population they constitute about 40 percent of active tuberculosis cases it recommended that immigrants from countries with high incidence of the disease mostly in asia and africa be screened for latent tuberculosis infections those who tested positive would still be allowed to enter the united states but would have to undergo evaluation and antibiotic therapy before they could get a permanent residency card the study was financed by the federal centers for disease control and prevention the institute of medicine is a private nonprofit institution that provides advice on health policy under a congressional charter to the national academy of sciences
directed by kristen coury not rated 87 minutes friends and family an independent feature directed by kristen coury and written by joseph triebwasser tries to crossbreed two popular subgenres of american farce the mafia comedies epitomized by harold ramis 's analyze this 1999 and the long string of gay coming out comedies that probably peaked around the time of mike nichols 's birdcage 1996 but both strains turn out to be too exhausted to reproduce further and friends and family quickly collapses into an overloaded slow moving series of predictable jokes and forced situations greg lauren and christopher gartin are respectively stephen and danny a pair of model handsome gay men who live in a tastefully appointed town house on stuyvesant street in the east village they support their cole porter lifestyle by working improbably as coldblooded enforcers for the mob the film which opens today in new york begins with an unpleasant sequence in which during an intermission at the opera they dash backstage clad in their perfect tuxedos to shake down a tenor who has been late in paying his gambling debts the men come off as little more than well spoken thugs but the moral issues do n't seem to have concerned or even to have occurred to ms coury who finds them endearing a cuddly update of leopold and loeb it 's meant to be hilarious that homosexuals can be as tough as any professional leg breaker and the movie 's central joke is that stephen and danny are much more efficient masters of violence than vito daniel mastrogiorgio and frankie lou carbonneau the two excessively gentle sons of the mafia boss don patrizzi tony lo bianco vito and frankie are n't gay it seems just heavily into cooking and sewing but while stephen and danny are out both to their don and to their parents they have n't told stephen 's midwestern parents beth fowler and frank pellegrino what it is they do for a living this causes complication when stephen 's mom and dad decide to drop in for a surprise visit expecting to find stephen and danny in charge of a successful catering business the surprise visit from the straight world is a staple of this kind of comedy but here instead of pretending to be heterosexuals the two protagonists must assume some ancient mincing gay stereotypes enlisting some of their fellow hit men all traditionally macho beefy brooklyn types to prance around as gay waiters they put on a dinner for their visitors that doubles for reasons best known to the screenwriter as an engagement dinner for the mafia boss 's daughter rebecca creskoff she too has a prospective in law problem her fiance 's parents are a pair of right wing militants tovah feldshuh and brian lane green who see their trip to new york as a chance to initiate a guerrilla war against the federal government with too many characters interacting in too many ways the film feels crowded confused and unproductively frenetic dave kehr
to the editor president bush faces a dilemma over the pentagon memo barring companies from france germany and russia from bidding on iraq reconstruction allies angered at exclusion from bidding news article dec 11 not to worry because at this rate they wo n't be allies much longer nathalie guyol waxahachie tex dec 11 2003
the united states central command combat surveillance video showed an iraqi military vehicle hiding beneath a bridge a smart bomb glided in from the right destroying the vehicle but leaving the bridge intact then came a surveillance picture of iraqi military communications equipment atop a building within some 2000 year old ruins on the bank of the tigris river a historic site recognized by the united nations in that case american commanders decided not to strike these two targets and the opposite decisions made as to whether to attack illustrate the complicated task given to american war planners who are charged with destroying a government but not a country the military mission calls for coalition forces to topple saddam hussein and rid his nation of any weapons of mass destruction that may be hidden there at the same time the war plan calls for leaving as much iraqi infrastructure as possible standing to ease postwar reconstruction and to minimize civilian deaths in order to quiet angry public opinion as the war enters its second week however military affairs experts ponder whether more indiscriminate bombing might in the end hasten victory and save the lives of american troops and even spare more iraqis the pain of a grinding ground war we decided we would restrain the use of air power for reasons of humanity and world image said loren thompson an air power expert at the lexington institute a policy research center here we have imposed a burden on our campaign plan that may slow down victory and diminish the quality of the victory we achieve american generals can ratchet up the violence delivered by air with just a command mr thompson noted and they are expected to do so as american ground forces move to face republican guard troops encircling baghdad the question is what measure of risk of civilian casualties and damage to buildings like hospitals and schools will be considered acceptable in order to secure a speedier victory this quandary has been placed upon american commanders by mr hussein who has ordered his forces arrayed in neighborhoods even using hospitals as garrisons according to pentagon officials the mantra heard at almost every wartime news conference held by defense secretary donald h rumsfeld or gen tommy r franks the senior commander for the war and his subordinates is that the american military will continue its efforts to exercise extreme prudence in choosing and attacking targets in order to minimize civilian deaths and damage to public works we have a very very deliberate process for targeting brig gen vincent brooks deputy director of operations for the united states central command said during a briefing in qatar today it 's unlike any other targeting process in the world it takes into account all science it takes into account all capability and we do everything physically and scientifically possible to be precise in our targeting and also to minimize secondary effects whether it 's on people or on structures but the second guessing is well under way selective bombing is wrongheaded perpetuating the regime causes more casualties certainly among iraqi troops than 'collateral damage would edward n luttwak a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies wrote in a commentary published by the los angeles times today even as some military experts in the academic world suggest that more intense bombing be considered today kofi annan the united nations secretary general became the latest international leader to serve notice that the united states will suffer far reaching consequences if it starts hitting targets that kill civilians and destroy infrastructure mr annan 's comments came as american officials reacted cautiously to reports that a marketplace in baghdad had been damaged by an explosion that left 14 people dead at the pentagon maj gen stanley mcchrystal said american forces had not aimed any ordnance at that neighborhood in the iraqi capital while officials could not absolutely rule out a hit by an errant american bomb or missile they also said the explosion might have been caused by iraqi antiaircraft fire falling back to earth or a faulty iraqi missile we do know for a fact that something landed in the shaab district general mcchrystal said but we do not know if it was us or iraqi we do know that we did not target anything in the vicinity proponents of air power have argued almost since the invention of the modern warplane that victory can be achieved through the air by attacking enemy leaders communications and the centers of gravity that prop up their governments for this war with iraq the air campaign had been planned to open the offensive and set the stage for the ground attack but that sequence had to be reversed after president bush ordered the surprise missile strike last wednesday in an effort to kill mr hussein and top iraqi leaders general mcchrystal said that since the war began more than 600 cruise missiles and 4300 other precision guided munitions have been launched at iraq but a week into the war air power experts acknowledge that the pentagon 's current bomb and missile campaign failed to deliver a quick knockout blow though that could still happen in recent days the air campaign shifted from mostly planned strikes against leadership targets and command or communications centers to attacks on iraq 's forces in the field specifically the republican guard divisions any analysis of the air campaign by anyone outside the most senior military commands and civilian leadership is naturally based on a hodgepodge of television images scattered witness reports from the front and a sense of history many of the effects of air operations are cumulative said eliot a cohen a professor at johns hopkins university who directed the air force 's definitive study of the first war against iraq at any given time you may think you 're not doing very much but suddenly when the right pressures come together the other guy collapses but he cautioned that the public 's view of the air war is opaque at best
to the editor as a practicing catholic i readily concur with paul e dinter 's description of american catholicism today op ed jan 1 the solution to our difficulties is to replace our monarchical church governance model with a democratic one unfortunately that would require us to go from the middle ages to the 21st century not an easy task chuck zannetti sacramento jan 1 2003
i was in my second year of college when i dropped out to chase a boy over to europe i hardly knew him the idle rumor that he had once said he liked me provided enough spark to ignite the journey carefully i laid my plans i wrote my parents of my unhappiness with school the lack of challenge my need for a break i scrounged the air fare i found a job waiting tables in a ski hotel outside innsbruck crammed berlitz german then dropped the fellow a casual line where he was studying in vienna i happened to be on the continent i wrote in case he was n't doing much and could use a traveling companion did it work gentle reader i fear it did in her travel writer 's romance my dream of you the irish novelist nuala o'faolain writes right at the end of my mind there was a golden blur this blur was love or hugo or passion no matter what i was thinking or doing talking to a boy in the queue and letting him buy me a cup of coffee reading the wonderfully glamorous place names on the sides of the wagons lit carriages on the platform at calais all the time the center of me was immobile rapt in front of that golden light when i count how many times i have enlisted travel in the service of that light i blush with the shame of a lesson unlearned several lessons in fact for there is traveling to find love traveling to fix love and traveling to feed love and each works on the heart in mysterious ways once i had landed my college quarry we joined forces to trace the castle building adventures of mad king ludwig we roamed up to berlin and back down to munich in a foggy black forest he taught me to whistle the only gift he gave me our sleeping arrangements ran the gamut from separate men 's and women 's hostel quarters to the narrow lobby benches of a sold out hotel in sold out frankfurt to a shared feather bed near mozart 's birthplace in salzburg like victor hugo 's daughter adele who followed an indifferent french officer to the new world i traveled with hope in my luggage every morning i woke believing the bright tulips or the crusty strudel would unlock the door to romance and then i lost him having run low on funds i bid my beloved auf wiedersehen and let him take a solo trip to prague while i earned a few more tips and planned to meet him a week later in amsterdam i knew somehow as the train chugged out of sight that i would never see this wayward boy again and i thought then that the whole trip had been a terrible waste of my time my money my passion if salzburg could n't get a man to fall in love with you i reasoned what could traveling to find love may not always be a doomed prospect my cousin mimi met her husband eurailing and any number of cruises use the possibility of shipboard romance as a chief draw but traveling to fix love surely is before the wedding my first husband and i made a pact that we would see italy together the image of the two of us sipping chianti high in the abruzzi sustained us through those early years when we had to content ourselves with a weekend backpacking expedition or a night out in little italy how happy we would be in florence regarding the david what bliss we would discover in a midnight gondola alas by the time we booked the tickets we were drifting apart we could scarcely agree on a brand of toothpaste much less an itinerary still we arrived at what we thought was a healing arrangement since he had a trust fund he would pay for the trip since i spoke italian i would be guide and interpreter this symbiosis along with the mediterranean sun and ripe olives would reheat our passion but we realized with a growing sense of guilt that the flame had died florence irritated us as if the city 's buoyant nature were to blame for our ennui as we browsed the uffizi our eyes wandered all the beds seemed too narrow the breakfasts too cold he tried hard not to complain about cost i tried harder not to complain about linguistic incompetence in the end we took separate flights home at the edges of these depressing scenes luckily glimmers another sort of romance when i look back on my college escapade i can hardly see the face of the young man toward whom i thought i was traveling what comes to mind instead are the shoulder high banks of snow on the alpine paths the chandeliers at the hotel sacher the heart stopping funicular ride up to garmisch partenkirchen the night before the object of my affection first found me in the village where i was waitressing my boss gave us the night off and the whole staff of the hotel slid downhill to the village polka dance where the postmaster bought me a dark beer and i was spun around the room in a giddy whirl of oompahs and lederhosen likewise my swan song trip to italy afforded me the pleasure of picnicking among sunlit ruins with the peculiar scents of goat cheese and warm stone as a means to get or keep love these journeys were dismal as forays through the world and back to the self they fulfilled their promise after all many travelers women particularly strike up liaisons simply for the companionship of the road who can say that romance even when it fires the blood is not simply a catalyst for seeing the world more intensely for oneself even adele hugo had she regained her presence of mind might have looked past her caddish officer to the sublime highlands of cape breton the swirling colors of barbados which brings me to my final category though trying to wring love out of travel seems a doomed effort traveling when in love can prove nourishing after all you hardly care where you go so long as you go there together time loses meaning a missed train is an opportunity on my second honeymoon we had trouble getting out of the house a friend had lent us in versailles when we finally decamped for mont st michel we both felt the need to shake love 's laziness and get some fresh french air so we rented a pair of squat bicycles the next day we set off along the scenic coast and in what seemed the blink of an eye we reached historic avranches where we ate tartines and cooled off in the town 's sparkling swimming pool then we turned south how we had not noticed that the trip was more than 12 miles each way that it was mostly hilly that the winds blew hard from the west that our bicycle seats were each six inches too low for good pedaling that i had developed a blister or that a storm front was moving in only cupid can say for a time we took refuge in an allied graveyard then soaked and shivering our thighs cramping we hobbled and creaked the final kilometers until my husband 's front tire blew and we walked that night there was plenty of tlc and no room for blame i never want to see avranches again but every time we recall that disastrous bicycle ride one or the other of us gets a hug they coexist uneasily the urge to explore and the urge to entwine but i am not ready altogether to set them apart essay lucy ferriss 's most recent novel is nerves of the heart university

jimmy fleming has pinpoint vision and short term memory problems his right hand shakes involuntarily he also has a sense of humor and a desire to share his story that story is about his bicycle accident on july 10 1985 mr fleming then 10 years old was out riding with a friend on his way to get some ice cream when he was hit by a car he flew up in the air as high as the telephone wires fell on the windshield and flipped over the back of the car landing on his head mr fleming was in a coma for 16 weeks and was totally blind for two years if he had worn a helmet his head injuries would have been far less severe which is why mr fleming who lives in pleasantville has spent the last five years going to schools boy scout and girl scout meetings and other places where children gather around westchester county promoting helmet safety for bicyclists skateboarders rollerbladers and skiers part lecture part stand up mr fleming 's 20 minute program resembles something you might see on the david letterman show it 's my way of lightening the mood a little said mr fleming who recently took his act to the northern westchester center for the arts where he studies theater quite frankly without a sense of humor my life would have been miserable q you interject jokes into your program have you been criticized for this a no i never make jokes about head injuries or undermine the importance of wearing helmets there 's nothing funny about these things at all i enjoy making people laugh i always have even before the accident my feeling is that if i just stood up and said to the kids you should wear your helmet because it reduces the risk of head injuries by 85 percent or it 's the law they 'd listen and say ok whatever when they hear me talk about my experience they appreciate the fact that i 'm not cynical or bitter and that i have a sense of humor in spite of it all the kids have remarked to me you have such courage and strength i get strength from hearing that q what sort of things do you talk about during your program a at one school i asked the kids to close their eyes for five minutes i asked them to keep them closed and do n't open them when five minutes was up i said now you can open your eyes i asked them what they saw they said nothing i told them that that is what i saw for two years i also tell them to look up at the telephone wires for a minute i say to them that is how high up i was when i was thrown from my bicycle that makes a big impact on them i like to talk about things that scare them then it will mean something q how do you know you 're making an impact on these kids a several years ago i went to the grand union with my dad he said to me jimmy wait right here i 'm waiting for my dad and this kid comes running up to me he told me he was in a bike accident a few weeks ago he said that if he had n't heard my talk he probably would n't have been wearing a helmet he wanted to thank me when i think about my accident i realize there are a few negatives but i also realize there are some positives hearing things like what this boy said are the positives q talk about this talent you have with letters and numbers a i honestly do n't know where that came from it happened after my brain was injured i can identify the letters of the alphabet by their numbers so anytime people tell me their names i see them in their number form i can do this automatically without even thinking about it i do this at the schools and the kids love it q people are constantly saying to you how do you keep your spirits up what do you say to that a my mom said that to me a lot after the accident she said jimmy how do you do it you make it so easy on me i say i just consider the alternative
seeming ever more frail pope john paul ii beatified mother teresa of calcutta on sunday as an icon of the good samaritan declaring her close to sainthood before tens of thousands of worshipers in st peter 's square the two hour ceremony said as much about the pope 's vitality though as it did about the memory of mother teresa whose image of devotion to the sick and needy has become an emblem of selflessness and piety with our apostolic authority we grant that the venerable servant of god teresa of calcutta shall from now on be called blessed the pope said in latin his voice was halting and indistinct as he pronounced mother teresa the latest of the more than 1300 people he has beatified in his 25 year tenure a huge portrait of mother teresa a nobel peace prize winner sometimes called the saint of the gutters for her work in calcutta was unfurled on the great facade of st peter 's basilica showing her smiling and deeply wrinkled her greatness lies in her ability to give without counting the cost to give 'until it hurts the pope 's homily said her life was a radical living and a bold proclamation of the gospel i am personally grateful to this brave woman who i always felt was at my side the sermon said though the words illuminated the pope 's feeling for mother teresa 's example the manner of their delivery betrayed his frailty for the first time on a major occasion the pope did not read a single line of his homily leaving it to cardinal ivan dias of bombay and others to speak for him when he said prayers in latin moreover his voice slurred to the point where his words were hard to understand senior aides also took over from him in saying mass when his voice weakened and tailed off people who have watched him closely in recent years said that the pope seemed particularly tired perhaps because he is midway through an intense series of public appearances those began with the celebrations of his quarter century as pope last thursday and are set to culminate on tuesday in the confirmation of 31 new cardinals the ceremonies on sunday blended the vatican 's solemnity with less austere moments indian women in white and gold saris bearing flowers swayed before the canopied altar on the steps of st peter 's basilica to music played on tabla and harmonium within the huge crowd said by the police to number 300000 although other estimates put the figure lower some people lauded the pope 's courage in defying the increasingly evident symptoms of parkinson 's disease others saw the remarkable spectacle of his physical decline as inspirational from his suffering and his humanity we can see his holiness said elena pelli a 19 year old italian law student in bright sunlight after a night of rain the pope was wheeled to an altar below the basilica on an upholstered chair and after the ceremony seemed to rally slightly as he was driven through the crowd in an open popemobile with few of the security trappings that usually surround figures of global stature beatification may be granted by the roman catholic church to a person who is seen as having been of overwhelming virtue whose goodness has been sustained after death and who is deemed to have interceded from beyond the grave in a miracle usually a medical cure for which there is said to be no scientific explanation once beatified the blessed and relics associated with them may be venerated the pope was presented on sunday with a piece of cloth stained with mother teresa 's blood that is to be displayed this week in a roman church for veneration beatification usually leads to sainthood once there is evidence of a second miracle mother teresa was born in 1910 in skopje now the capital of macedonia a former yugoslav republic she died in 1997 after spending most of her life in calcutta living in poverty as she ministered to the poorest and least privileged she founded her order the missionaries of charity in 1950 with 12 nuns it now has 4500 sisters in more than 130 countries like mother teresa the nuns wear the simple white saris edged in blue that were once associated with the street sweepers of calcutta from the earliest hours on sunday people began gathering in st peter 's square and along the wide via della conciliazione leading to it some brought their own sick in wheelchairs hoping for miracles others relished the sense of occasion that vatican officials are skilled at building among the crowd many waved red and black albanian flags to honor mother teresa 's origins although the claim to her memory is disputed between albanian and macedonian nationalists presidents princes dignitaries and politicians from 27 countries including the united states attended the open air ceremony the week of ecclesiastical events surrounding the beatification has been closely choreographed to ensure its impact not only do the church 's scarlet robed cardinals lend a sense of gravity and occasion but the timing of mother teresa 's beatification which drew bigger numbers than the pope 's own anniversary mass on thursday virtually assured that pilgrims would flood here from around the world this is like witnessing the faith of so many people said cathy o'donnell 48 who had traveled from stephens city va some in the crowd said they believed the pope had scheduled the events so close together because he sensed that time was running out perla godino 21 an italian art student said he is a great pope who wants to do things in his way and added he is bringing his mission to its completion pope john paul ii 's papacy has set records not only for beatifications but also for sainthoods the pope has canonized more than 470 new saints since he took office those who gathered for the ceremony dismissed suggestions by the pope 's critics that he had bent the church 's rules by permitting mother teresa 's supporters to complete the processes leading to beatification so soon after her death usually five years must elapse before the process begins but the pope waived that requirement for mother teresa and approved a miracle last year curing an indian woman of a tumor said to be cancerous that some held to be contentious she was already a saint said lucielle hoyon 56 of paris
to the editor a may 24 letter writer takes umbrage at the simon schuster executive who promoting electronic books referred to a book as a container the writer says the book should be respected as an object of value and beauty in itself the writer might consider the difference between a painting which embodies art and a book which copies it destroy the painting and the art is gone destroy a particular volume and the art is unaffected an identical replacement sits on the shelf at your local bookstore so much is reflected in the conventional usage that a writer sells copies as a book collector i know that copies can be beautifully printed and bound and that one can become attached to these customary physical trappings but confusing the contents with the container risks missing the advantages that a new delivery system might promise true book lovers will appreciate any system that augments their enjoyment of the art and there are situations in which the electronic reader does that dramatically william r andersen seattle may 24 2000
as democratic chief of staff on the senate finance committee lawrence o'donnell jr spent a lot of time sitting through important congressional meetings but his agenda was a bit different from everyone else 's i would take two different kinds of notes mr o'donnell said one set related to the policy we were working on in the room and the other was about the atmospherics that were going on i always knew i 'd be leaving government someday i just did n't know when there was something about knowing that it was temporary that left me in writerly observational mode the first set of notes came in handy while mr o'donnell held the finance post from 1993 to 1995 the second set though continues to pay dividends as mr o'donnell channels the information into mister sterling which had its premiere this month the new nbc series centers on the trials and tribulations of an idealistic young lawyer josh brolin who also happens to be the son of william sterling a popular ex governor of california played by james whitmore when one of the state 's senators dies suddenly the younger mr sterling is unexpectedly given the temporary appointment to take his place the series may be a modern more issue oriented version of mr smith goes to washington but mr o'donnell who first began writing the show in 1992 and is one of its executive producers says it 's not strictly about politics this is a show in which the lead character 's first statement about politics is 'i hate politics he said right there we 're welcoming in viewers who do n't like politics this show is n't c span it 's about human drama and conflict we wo n't stay locked in congressional offices nbc executives also maintain that even though this is the network 's second show involving politicians mister sterling has very little in common with the west wing the emmy award winning series on which mr o'donnell previously worked as a writer and producer we felt like our schedule can support two shows like this said karey burke executive vice president for development of prime time series at nbc after all you can have different kinds of cop shows and different kinds of doctor shows why not different kinds of politician shows and mister sterling certainly tries to make its title character different rather than be a dyed in the wool democrat a la president bartlet on west wing mr sterling is a devout independent he supports oil drilling in alaska but also wants money to hire teachers for inmates he hops from one side of the fence to another depending on the issue something that mr o'donnell and the network hope will more accurately reflect how most americans and their elected officials really think the truth is even people who work within the parties are much more independent in private thinking than their public postures indicate mr o'donnell said they all have a list of things they dislike about what their parties are doing and that includes mr brolin the son of the actor james brolin and stepson of the decidedly democratic barbra streisand mr brolin was initially reluctant to take the role of mr sterling because he feared the show would be too partisan after meeting with mr o'donnell though he quickly changed his mind i was the kid with the mohawk growing up i was n't alec baldwin he said i do n't care about politics i vote and get involved when i need to i do it personally i would n't hire me to play a senator because i 'm not typical but lawrence wanted somebody who goes against the grain the notion of a truly independent united states senator let alone one with mr brolin 's movie star good looks is certainly not indicative of what americans have come to expect from their congressional representatives i do n't know if 'the west wing is really like the way politics is in this country but this show is fiction and can be idealistic mr brolin said but he added what you see on the show is not not possible it 's that fantasy element that really hooked the network it 's the same thing we saw with 'er ms burke said those were the doctors you wished could treat you with 'mister sterling these characters are the people we wish had these jobs in washington in real life but mr o'donnell though admitting to moments in every episode when he 'd think gee i 'd like to see things done this way in real life considers the series a pretty realistic depiction of the limits of power i 'm not trying to teach any lessons he said that might happen and i 'd be open to the possibility that people will say 'oh he 's trying to say this about that policy but that 's not what 's consciously driving my writing mr o'donnell does not think of mister sterling as particularly democratic or liberal he prefers to use another term activist i think this would be a little problematic dramatically if you tried to make a show about a conservative and the republicans would probably agree he said they want to do less in government and that 's a trickier thing to go at in drama how does a scene work when your character is the guy who does n't want to do something it 's a trickier thing trying to find the drama in that so for a tv show being activist is a good thing political correctness does n't hurt either the part of mr sterling 's chief of staff was n't written for an african american woman and at first that 's what kept audra mcdonald from auditioning for it i was protecting myself from disappointment said ms mcdonald who is best known for her award winning broadway performances i thought it was a great script but figured they 'd never cast me because i 'm black but everyone there really pushed for me because the thinking is very open minded for a tv show while mr o'donnell and the network do n't want to push politics too hard ms mcdonald said she was confident that audiences would be getting a civics lesson i hope we have an effect on people she said i 'd like this show to advance really good ideas and make people more aware of their own voice that 's certainly not out of the realm of possibility according to ms burke after 'er went on the air i heard that medical school enrollment started going up she said cover story craig tomashoff is a television critic

the funny thing about the university of okoboji winter games has always been that there is no university this year there was no winter but the games must go on in sleet in snow and yes even in sunshine so instead of parking cars on smith 's bay where the ice this weekend was about 8 inches thick instead of the typical 40 organizers used a dirt lot on the shores of west lake okoboji a

to the editor paul krugman column feb 27 suggests that market indexes like the dow jones industrial average are irrelevant for long term investors because the successful companies of the future may not even exist yet and are therefore unrepresented in any market index he says if you buy the dow you only buy a claim on the future earnings of the companies currently in the index that 's not a trivial distinction mr krugman is correct if i invest directly in the companies that make up the dow but if i invest using a mutual fund a fund tracking the dow gives me a stake in all the companies in the dow for as long as i hold it hence a long term investor need not speculate on the success of companies unborn he must predict only the index they will appear in andrew g biggs washington feb 28 2000 the writer is an analyst at the cato institute
when senator john mccain had a routine checkup for skin cancer on july 27 a few days before the republican convention dr john f eisold the attending physician of the united states capitol spotted a mole on his patient 's left temple and told him you ought to have that checked the checkup was one of many regular exams mr mccain has undergone since he had a malignant melanoma removed from his left shoulder in 1993 the doctors had pronounced him cured of that melanoma but it is too soon to know how serious the new one on his temple will be after the recent checkup mr mccain moved swiftly on aug 1 after speaking at the convention in philadelphia the senator took the train to washington two days later he went to bethesda naval medical center in maryland where doctors detected another suspicious mole on his left upper arm and performed a biopsy on each mole that evening mr mccain returned to the convention and wore a bandage over part of his left temple when he appeared on stage with gov george w bush the republican presidential nominee a week later on aug 10 mr mccain learned in a call from bethesda that the moles were new malignant melanomas mr mccain who later said he was surprised by the diagnosis then arranged to have a second opinion and additional tests performed through dr john d eckstein his personal physician at the mayo clinic here on saturday mr mccain had a five and a half hour operation to remove the two melanomas and lymph nodes in his head and neck today as mr mccain 63 recovers at the mayo clinic hospital here he is awaiting a determination by pathologists on whether the temple melanoma has spread preliminary tests before and during surgery indicated that the cancer was confined to the skin his doctors said the quickness with which mr mccain and his doctors reacted in the last three weeks contrasts sharply with a similar situation in 1993 at that time it took more than six months before mr mccain sought care after a navy doctor recommended that he consult a dermatologist for what turned out to be his first melanoma the one removed from his left shoulder mr mccain 's experience with the more than six month delay in 1993 led him to act much faster this time and the episode in 1993 underlies the senator 's repeated urging that other people get checked for skin cancer for instance mr mccain stood in front of his home on friday after undergoing tests at the hospital to emphasize the benefits of detecting melanomas and other cancers at an early stage when they are most curable the delay in 1993 was documented in the hundreds of pages of medical records mr mccain released during the presidential primary campaign and was verified in interviews with his doctors the records included the annual checkups that mr mccain underwent as a volunteer in the program for all former prisoners of war that the military conducts in pensacola fla the pensacola doctors spotted a dark irregularly shaped area of skin on mr mccain 's left shoulder during a checkup on may 7 1993 but the records show they did not suspect a melanoma a letter from a navy doctor dated june 8 1993 recommended that mr mccain consult a dermatologist for what the pensacola doctors said they thought was a noncancerous condition actinic keratosis which results from chronic sun exposure it was not until nov 24 1993 that mr mccain sought care for the skin condition he went to dr thomas m hudak a plastic surgeon in phoenix who had treated mr mccain 's wife cindy dr hudak said in an earlier interview that though the dark area on the skin was not an obvious melanoma he suspected it was a cancer after years of seeing many lesions like this it just sort of caught my eye dr hudak said the melanoma had escaped the eye of dr eckstein mr mccain 's personal physician who said in an interview that he did n't recognize it if it was there when he examined mr mccain in 1992 undoubtedly it was there dr eckstein said the reasons for the delay in 1993 are not clear now said nancy ives mr mccain 's press secretary but ms ives said that mr mccain might have put off seeking medical care in part because of a heavy speaking schedule on behalf of other republicans because individuals with one melanoma can develop more they are advised to have periodic checkups dr hudak said he had removed several noncancerous moles from mr mccain 's skin including one from his left temple on oct 4 1998 it was a type known as a pigmented junctional nevus mr mccain recalled on friday that the new melanoma appeared near the spot where the benign mole had been melanomas can occasionally go undetected in a biopsy for many reasons one is misdiagnosis a second reason is disagreement among pathologists in interpreting what they see through a microscope if you send slides of a suspected melanoma to a dozen dermatologists some will call it normal and some will read it as a melanoma said dr bernard s goffe a dermatologist in seattle that 's a well known fact a third reason is that pathologists do not examine every millimeter of the tissue removed in a biopsy they take representative sections from different areas thus a melanoma that is confined to a small area of a mole may escape examination as a result of sampling errors when a new melanoma is detected in an area where a mole was removed and diagnosed as benign doctors usually review the microscopic slides to determine if the melanoma was present but missed in the initial testing dr eckstein said on saturday that no evidence of a melanoma had been detected in such a review of the mole that was removed from mr mccain in 1998 even early detection of melanomas is not foolproof because such cancers can be quirky recurring suddenly and unexpectedly decades after they are first detected yet when such metastases have occurred many people have gone on for years without further medical problems and sometimes a melanoma can first develop in the bowel or brain without ever having appeared on the skin scientists do not know why melanomas can behave so peculiarly

sometimes success in television turns to failure faster than a teenager can change channels this is an especially painful truth at vh1 these days once a cultural force for baby boomers vh1 is not just a fading music channel with a ratings slide it has become a major worry for viacom its parent company that is why viacom has brought in the mtv programming president brian graden a cable wunderkind known to have an uncanny eye for hit programs it hopes he will be able to pull off the delicate balancing act of trying to reach what it considers the ideal broad vh1 audience those in their mid 20 's who have graduated beyond the pierced bubble gum pop of mtv through those who remember swimming in the mud of woodstock the first time industry executives will be watching closely mr graden 's touch in the late 1990 's brought new hits to basic cable that broke the old rules with raw anything goes humor and ultimately pushed the barriers of taste for all television when the pop culture history of the last decade is written it will certainly not leave out graden backed projects like south park on comedy central and jackass and the osbournes at mtv a lot is riding on the continued success of mr graden 's golden instincts for viacom in the last two years vh1 an important revenue generator has failed to develop any new hits instead relying on old shows like behind the music the biography program about rock stars from days gone by 80 's sensations milli vanilli motley crue def leppard in the meantime its average audience decreased more than 20 percent in the past year to 200000 people last quarter with even worse dips in key demographic categories some weeks that has cost viacom tens of millions of dollars in rebates to advertisers who did not reach as large an audience as vh1 had promised and were compensated with free spots with so much advertising time filled with those give backs vh1 ran out of room to accommodate everyone viacom was forced to find time on its healthier networks like mtv and tnn officials said mel karmazin the president of viacom was not pleased suddenly one of viacom 's proudest assets had become a serious liability even as its younger skewing music channel sibling mtv climbed to historic highs there is wide consensus in the television industry that mr graden with help from vh1 's new general manager christina norman is the right person to right the ship his responsibilities were extended to vh1 last week by judy mcgrath the mtv networks music group president who took charge of vh1 when john sykes the former vh1 president was put in charge of infinity radio in march mr graden effectively replaces fred graver head vh1 programmer for a year there is considerable fear within mtv networks that mr graden a harvard mba may be spread too thin and that the division of his attention could hurt both vh1 and mtv but that seems to be counterbalanced by general impatience for a recovery at vh1 it 's a drag on everybody said one viacom executive ms mcgrath said mtv was humming along so well that mr graden would have ample time to focus on his new charge people inside and outside viacom often take jabs at vh1 referring to the cobwebs hanging on the behind the music and before they were rock stars franchises and blame an over reliance on those shows for vh1 's problems they just basically ran their hits into the ground said larry gerbrandt chief content officer of kagan world media a media research firm but current and former viacom executives said that after so many years building a rock solid brand identity for vh1 its leadership erred recently in trying to make the network so long considered a haven for baby boomers more narrowly focused on the hipper younger members of generation x those in their late 20 's to mid 30 's taking aim at generation x had its own difficulties some at vh1 felt it was dangerous to put so much emphasis on a younger demographic that considered it a network for older people while risking the alienation of its more mature core many at viacom felt the team spent too much time wringing hands about the target audience and not enough time making television supporters of mr graver said he was not given enough time to make things work none of the four new programs introduced in march including a nighttime talk show late world with zach and a music trivia show called never mind the buzzcocks generated much attention or ratings mr graden now has his work cut out for him to reach what is jokingly referred to as the new vh1 target people with eyeballs he has been here before he found mtv in a similar position when he arrived there in 1997 with mtv riding on the strength of programs like real world but little else it was bleeding ratings and revenues they were in a little bit of a calamity he said in a telephone interview people would say 'if we were just cooler more people would watch there was too much concern about marketing and not enough about programming he added mr graden said he quickly began to apply his formula it does not include any grand vision he says he casts aside focus group research and follows his instincts assigning a team to produce inexpensive experimental pilots freely and keeping an open mind to their ideas like following the family of an aging rock star the osbournes or showing someone stun himself with a taser gun jackass i believe in constantly being open and never thinking you know too much he said sometimes the good ideas are the ones that borrow nothing from the world before them if somebody came in a year ago and pitched ozzy osbourne as the next big thing on paper nobody would have bought that before he started at mtv mr graden was already somewhat of a cable legend as a young executive at the news corporation 's foxlabs experimental programming studio in the mid 1990 's he discovered the hit young animators matt stone and trey parker to keep them in his fold he gave them 2000 to create a video christmas card for him featuring the characters of what is now south park that made the rounds in hollywood eventually to become south park on comedy central of course what appeals to an mtv audience that includes teenage girls and fraternity boys will not necessarily appeal to the more grown up vh1 audience mr graden acknowledges that he is being asked to draw a broader audience than that of mtv but his biggest hits like the osbournes and south park have appealed to people of all ages he said he would seek programs he considered funny or insightful or touching and hope his tastes squared with those of the audience you ca n't be that precious about it he said my job is to find that universal emotional connection he said he believed his instincts would be on the mark at vh1 because just like many in the vh1 audience his tastes are maturing beyond mtv at some point i 'll grow out of it and i 'll just program vh1 he said and after that i 'll go program the aarp channel

most music fans congregating in napster 's chat rooms yesterday afternoon were seeking an answer to a simple question as anongirl put it succinctly how long do we have besides setting off a stampede to download free music before it is too late yesterday 's decision by a three judge panel of the ninth circuit court of appeals in san francisco that napster should be prohibited from enabling the swapping of copyrighted music appeared to hand a significant victory to the recording industry in its crusade against internet piracy but the second most asked question among napster users yesterday may indicate that major record labels that sued napster for copyright infringement have a longer way to go to win in the court of public opinion jeffoboy15 's query does anyone know of any other programs for music transfer was echoed and answered by many others the answer is that there are several although none provide the wide range of music or the ease of use of napster much of the debate over napster has centered on whether consumers have a fair use right under copyright law to share music that they already own with whomever they saw fit whether it be one friend or napster 's 58 million users the court ruled yesterday that napster users were infringing copyrights in its decision the court said napster would be required to remove any copyrighted material that it was informed was being being traded through its service and officials at the recording industry association of america the trade group that sued napster on behalf of the major record companies talked of new technologies that would make it possible to identify the copyrighted songs stored on the computers of the individuals who make them available for other napster users to download and listen to but the extraordinary napster phenomenon has been fueled only in part by the technology that made it possible it is also based in the antipathy many users express toward the music industry and the sense that the cost of compact discs is far too high hey napster is stealing songs one participant in the alternative napster chat room wrote yesterday afternoon you must admit if there was no napster you would pay for cd 's another responded no i 'd just burn my friends cd 's the music industry is getting too much cash from kids to burn a cd is to transfer computer files onto a compact disc aware of the sentiments of the napster users some legal scholars who disagreed with parts of the ninth circuit 's decision said the ruling would ultimately work against the recording industry my view is that the riaa loses the battle and loses the war because they become the bad guys said lawrence lessig an expert on internet law at stanford university with every song they tell napster to remove the political resistance to this extreme view of copyright law will grow stronger napster with backing from the bertelsmann music group plans to make a subscription service available in the fall several legal experts said the court decision yesterday would probably encourage a settlement between napster and other major record labels which might enable napster to offer more music by subscription in the meantime however napster users may have to find other alternatives and judging from their online comments few seemed inclined to return to the record store the leading possible substitutes like gnutella and freenet are considerably harder to use but they are also harder to police because unlike napster they do not maintain a central index of users that share music files the developers of those programs said they did not see how the court ruling could be applied to them this is going to make life difficult for a lot of music swapping fans out there said gene kan a developer of gnutella but maybe the larger concern should be that there 's no above ground alternative for napster users in the sense that the music industry has not come forward with their own version of napster to allow people to swap files on line which is something they obviously want to do of the major record labels only bertelsmann has sought to build a fee based music sharing service by teaming with napster many napster users have said they are willing to pay a small fee to use the new service if it works as the current version does to provide access to much of the world 's music but few have expressed an abiding loyalty to napster as it goes mainstream and perhaps unfortunately for the music industry the ability to share digital music files in the mp3 format has acquired a certain subversive cachet that may be hard to shake if napster does shut down there are more sites out there obsidian tempest 24 a security guard and disc jockey in ontario wrote in an e mail message to a reporter and they may get a few but they ca n't stop all of them wes feltz 16 of pittsburgh wrote in an e mail message they 'll never stop mp3 's they 'll always exist i can upload mp3 's on my web site right now if i want to mr feltz for one is not worried about finding a napster alternative he said he had enough cd 's to listen to for now because over the six months that he has been using napster he has burned almost 70 separate discs

as i walked through the local airport last week a baggage handler recognized me and shouted if these two guys ca n't get together and solve this mess neither deserves to be president while his view might not be a realistic solution for the nation the handler was right about the need for the candidates to take control and agree on some sort of process that will bring closure to this election in a very real way the first test of whether al gore or george w bush can be an effective president of the united states is now not the day after the inauguration so far both have allowed their campaign organizations to engage in continuing campaigns to convince the public of the fairness of their positions deploying lawyers spokesmen and campaign managers this way may satisfy the appetite to fight but not the responsibility to reconcile a serious national dilemma no one disputes that this is a unique and challenging moment in our history to have a national election of over 100 million votes come down to a few hundred controversial ballots in florida is without precedent it is understandable that both campaigns having fought long and hard for their candidates want to do whatever it takes to get the very last votes they need to win but while a scorched earth litigation process to the bitter end may make sense to the lawyers and the campaign officials does it make sense for the nation it is obvious that the united states is deeply divided over who should win aggravating those differences in a bitter post election battle will only make it that much more difficult for the winner to govern after the federal court decision not to interfere with florida law both candidates now face a crucial choice they could continue to litigate each election decision that is not acceptable challenging close votes not only throughout florida but in wisconsin iowa new mexico and other states where there are disputed results and continue the battle for votes right up to the electoral college decision in december and perhaps beyond with the supreme court and sheer public exhaustion finally ending the matter or they could come together either in person or through trusted emissaries and agree to a process that would bring this election to closure as fairly and responsibly as possible the choice is theirs since the florida outcome is the deciding factor they could agree for example to allow both sides to hand count those votes that can be challenged under florida law and could establish a deadline perhaps dec 1 for conclusion of that process and complete counting of the absentee ballots the secretary of state for florida could then certify the final results before the electoral college votes both candidates would agree to abide by that final count this kind of agreement between mr gore and mr bush might not satisfy the campaigns or the lawyers or even some of the voters but it would be the right thing for the nation now the candidates are fighting a legal and propaganda war that both are losing more important the nation is losing the presidency is about putting the nation 's interest first having served the president i know the hardest decisions that confront this nation 's leaders are the ones that pit the long term interests of the country against short term political gain deploying troops raising taxes vetoing key legislation or revealing a mistake of judgment may not be very popular but it may be right for the country the legacy of every president rests with how he responds to that choice both of these candidates have campaigned on the basis that they would make the tough choices if and when the time came that time is now leon panetta who was white house chief of staff under president clinton from 1994 to 1997 teaches at california state university at monterey bay

'the decalogue krzysztof kieslowski 's 10 part masterwork was first shown on polish television in 1988 89 and finally released in theaters this year it is a sweeping meditation on the human condition
