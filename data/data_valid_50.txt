to the editor re restructuring for security by warren rudman and gary hart op ed june 13 if all the disparate agencies in this new homeland security department border patrol customs service coast guard and so on are to focus on fighting terrorists does this mean we have conceded the war on drugs in 1968 we spent 60 million fighting drugs now we spend upward of 20 billion yet drugs are readily available and the street cost of drugs has remained more or less constant possibly focusing on terrorism will mean that the government will spend its limited drug money on prevention and treatment which even richard m nixon recognized as the only way to win the war on drugs fred polvere yonkers june 13 2002

don king the boxing promoter has stated that my recent presidential exploratory campaign was one of the greatest promotions of all time sadly many have agreed with him and have thought that my foray into presidential politics was done for the purpose of further heightening the trump name helping to sell my new book and building even greater awareness of my various real estate developments that however is not the case i seriously thought that america might be ready for a businessman president someone with an eye for the bottom line someone who has created thousands of jobs and is n't part of the inside the beltway buddy system i also thought that americans might be ready for straight talk and that they would find an unscripted candidate appealing jesse ventura 's victory in minnesota served as my model a nonpolitician celebrity who spoke uncommonly straight to the voters mr ventura came out of nowhere to beat two experienced big name politicians at a time of economic prosperity and he did so as the nominee of a fledgling third party the reform party was my chosen vehicle because its nomination process does not involve a long string of early primaries but instead culminates in one national primary conducted by mail and e mail in august refreshingly democratic the reform party process would lend itself to a candidate with national name recognition and the financial resources to flood the process with new people a presidential exploratory campaign is the greatest civics lesson that a private citizen can have in the course of my exploration i met dozens of talented dedicated reform party members who were involved with little reward or recognition solely because of their commitment to cleaning up the american political system i marveled at the long and thankless hours put in by people like the new york independence party chairman jack essenberg the former national chairman russ verney and the minnesota reform party chairman rick mccluhan i also saw the underside of the reform party the fringe element that wanted to repeal the federal income tax believed that the country was being run by the trilateral commission and suspected that my potential candidacy was a stalking horse for take your pick gov george w bush senator john mccain or vice president al gore when i held a reception for reform party leaders in california the room was crowded with elvis look alikes resplendent in various campaign buttons and anxious to give me a pamphlet explaining the swiss zionist conspiracy to control america three things happened to destroy any viable chance that i may have had to run an insurgent candidacy in the fall the commission on presidential debates made up solely of republicans and democrats produced debate criteria specifically designed to keep the reform party 's candidate out of the fall debates i felt confident that i could sell the american people if i could get into the debate but my lawyers told me that was unlikely i preferred a race against mr bush and mr gore two establishment politicians whose nominations looked certain and whose issue positions seemed virtually indistinguishable both support america 's current trade policies including nafta and the world trade organization i felt confident that my argument that america was being ripped off by our major trade partners and that it was time for tougher trade negotiations would have resonance in a race against the two ivy league contenders the rise of john mccain running on a reform message made the opportunity for this contrast difficult and depending on the outcome of the south carolina primary perhaps impossible finally the fratricide in the national reform party drove the party 's most prominent star jesse ventura out of the party and culminated in a nationally televised meltdown at the national meeting last week in which the proceedings grew so unruly that someone called 911 to ask the police to restore order although i am totally comfortable with the people in the new york independence party i leave the reform party to david duke pat buchanan and lenora fulani that is not company i wish to keep in the days before i decided to end my presidential exploratory effort i was watching cnn and saw vice president gore trudging through the snow in subzero temperatures knocking on doors in new hampshire an obvious look of drudgery on his face my experience was quite different i had enormous fun thinking about a presidential candidacy and count it as one of my great life experiences although i must admit that it still does n't compare with completing one of the great skyscrapers of manhattan i can not rule out another bid for the presidency in 2004 donald j trump is the president of the trump organization
to the editor bill keller god and george w bush column may 17 said many of the things that i and others have been seriously thinking about nowadays whenever george w bush pops a bit of theology into one of his speeches it scares many of us this is coming mind you from a 55 year old man who believes strongly in god not in the pious judgmental hypocritical arrogance of many organized religions but definitely in a divine power as a native rural texan and as someone who 's kept a close eye on george w bush for the last eight years i truly believe that this is a man of misguided principles whether he 's simply pandering to ultraright fundamentalists or on some kind of religious crusade that could turn into armageddon i want no part of it or him mike beuershausen kingsland tex may 17 2003
andres rios stood in front of il monello and recited its dishes from memory his voice caressed the list as if he could taste the food as he spoke there is the veal monello with asparagus and sweet peppers topped with a white wine sauce and melted fontina cheese he said there is the chicken toscano mr rios continued as he has at this restaurant at second avenue near 76th street for a quarter of a century but this day he recited the list outside il monello he and 10 other waiters busboys and cooks who belong to hotel employees and restaurant employees local 100 had been fired last month a few weeks before a new owner closed the place perhaps for good the former owner adi giovanetti who still runs il nido on 53rd street originally closed il monello on dec 31 telling employees he was sick in march the restaurant reopened with the same name the same menu mr giovanetti 's son frank as the manager and a nonunion staff when mr rios and other original workers returned to get their jobs back they were told they would not be rehired the new owner bruce witherell an executive at lehman brothers who describes himself as a golfing buddy of frank giovanetti 's had bought the restaurant in february he said he did so as a favor to his friend but because of high market rents could not afford to pay benefits adi giovanetti had owned the building during his tenure the current landlord is 1460 second realty when the restaurant reopened on march 12 the old workers began picketing they greeted customers at the door many of whom then refused to enter the restaurant mr witherell said the old employees could have returned with benefits if they worked alongside nonunion staff all have refused to do so according to a union representative a clause in the contract states that anyone who takes over il monello must abide by its terms over a month of picketing the number of customers dropped to 15 to 30 a day the restaurant which mr rios said needed 80 customers a day to break even finally closed its doors last weekend if i had known there was a risk of these issues i would never have gone near the thing said mr witherell who is looking for a new buyer i was helping a friend i thought it would be fun to be involved with a restaurant and make a little money this has been a zoo andrew friedman
bluetooth an emerging technology for wirelessly connecting digital devices gained support from the leading hand held computer maker yesterday when palm inc introduced kits that help software developers create bluetooth programs with the release of the kits palm hopes that many of the 175000 developers registered to write software for the palm operating system will invent new uses for bluetooth and accelerate its adoption like many device makers palm has been slow in meeting its promise to offer a variety of uses for bluetooth in the marketplace bluetooth uses radio waves to carry data between computers cellphones and other properly equipped devices a few companies are selling bluetooth adapters for those products but the real surge in demand is not expected until manufacturers build the capability directly into the devices palm envisions its users wirelessly synchronizing their hand held computers with their personal computers and cellphones tapping into networks to surf the internet sharing documents and playing video games against other hand held owners palm which is based in santa clara calif released free software tools for creating bluetooth programs that work with the palm operating system which runs the hand held computers sold by palm and other manufacturers that license it like handspring and sony for 199 palm will also begin selling its developers a hardware kit that includes two bluetooth adapters that plug into the expansion slot in new hand held models michael mccamon chairman of a bluetooth marketing group said the announcement was an important step in the adoption of the technology after similar announcements from microsoft the world 's largest software company microsoft built bluetooth support into its operating system for mobile devices and said it would offer similar support this summer for windows xp which runs personal computers palm had made earlier versions of its software and hardware kits available to about 60 developers but said other developers had been clamoring for the tools this is the last step necessary before bluetooth programs start shipping said michael mace chief competitive officer for palm 's software division he said he expected new bluetooth programs in the next three months adding bluetooth is imminent but palm users will have little use for those programs until their hand held computers can use bluetooth the company 's executives have vowed to make bluetooth and other technologies for wireless transmission available in their products by the fall last week at the consumer electronics show in las vegas palm announced an agreement with the chip maker broadcom to build bluetooth access into future hand held computers but did not say when the technology would be available
as spider man in sam raimi 's film which opens today review weekend page 1 the vegetarian tobey maguire may not fit a steak eater 's notion of a superhero but he seems to come close to what stan lee had in mind when he and the artist steve ditko rolled out that marvel comics action figure in 1962 on a couple of new dvd 's mr lee says he wanted the average person to identify with spider man a k a peter parker which meant giving him more feelings and saddling him with worries about girls family and friends i gave peter parker as many problems as i could mr lee says in spider man the ultimate villain showdown released this week on dvd and videocassette by buena vista he was n't a popular kid some of parker 's vulnerability rubs off on spider man who has an asthma attack fighting a villain and there was responsibility here was a superhero who used his powers not only to fight evil but also to swing off to get medicine for his ailing aunt may the most important thing is to do the right thing mr lee says you do n't have to be the greatest at anything that young kid with no special power who does right is more of a hero than a superhero if there was any message in the comic strip he adds that was it the ultimate villain showdown includes several episodes from the old animated television series with the web slinger in action against the green goblin the kingpin and others mr lee talks about his work and introduces each episode he says the animated cartoons are a little happier a little simpler than the comics on the disc mr lee says he has written a comic book version of the raimi movie on another dvd stan lee 's mutants monsters marvels to be released may 14 by columbia tristar also on videocassette he and the director kevin smith a comic book buff talk about the film and the comics mr lee says that when he conceived the character he wanted an original with a superhero you need a guy with a new power he says he saw a fly crawling on a wall fly man did n't work or mosquito man his boss at marvel did not like the idea of a spider either or that the superhero was a teenager that would not be credible or so it was thought now we know otherwise mr smith wonders why it took so long to put marvel comics science fiction figures like spider man and the characters in brian singer 's x men 2000 onto the big screen there being no ready answer to that they move on to mr lee 's contribution to the raimi film not only did he do a comic book version but he was also to make an appearance in a cameo in the scene which was cut mr lee is selling sunglasses in times square when disaster strikes and he runs in panic on reflection he says running did n't do justice to a stan lee hero so he asked to shoot the scene again this time he was to pick up a little girl and carry her to safety but he says the girl was too heavy and he took too long raimi said 'stan if we do it your way it will be a mini series mr lee says

unmuzzling the dogs q when i was a little girl new york had a law that dogs were not allowed out without a muzzle is that law still on the books a we would not be so ungallant as to reveal a questioner 's age deliberately but the muzzle law was repealed on aug 11 1942 it was replaced by a requirement for the use of a leash when walking a dog the current law states a person who owns possesses or controls a dog shall not permit it to be in any public place or in any open or unfenced area abutting on a public place unless the dog is effectively restrained by a leash or chain not more than six feet long additionally the penal code prohibits an unmuzzled ferocious or vicious dog from being at large in any thoroughfare or public place in the city classy vaudevillians q i recently learned that my great aunt danced with an art dance group called the marion morgan dancers in the early 20th century do you have any information on their appearances in new york a the jerome robbins dance collection at the lincoln center library of the performing arts has a charming collection of clippings of the marion morgan dancers apparently if mrs morgan 's press representatives were to be believed the troupe was formed in 1915 when she selected 6 young women from more than 12000 who had studied with her at manual arts high school in los angeles and the university of california at berkeley they made their debut at the waldorf and caused a sensation they were swamped with professional offers including a february 1916 date at the palace theater the pinnacle of vaudeville success their specialty was ballets arranged from classical legends a repertoire that included pieces like helen of troy the fetching young ladies were draped in togas and danced barefoot morgan also devised for them a dance drama titled in the time of attila and the huns based much of the time on the west coast they were frequently photographed by arnold genthe and even turn up in the work of edward weston the company 's principal venue was vaudeville rather than the legitimate stage but that is not to be sneered at vaudeville showcased an extraordinary range of performing arts the company worked the prestigious keith circuit and morgan enjoyed a successful business relationship with the producer martin beck they enjoyed considerable success in the 1920 's until the talkies finished off vaudeville they can be seen in fluffy part talkies like manhattan cocktail 1928 and the 1930 revue film paramount on parade the most famous alumna of the marion morgan dancers was probably rose cowan who is better known as the mexican painter rosa rolanda the silent movie star ramon novarro is also reputed to have studied with morgan whither murray hill 6 q how many named telephone exchanges were there in the city before all digit dialing took hold a it 's a bit shocking to revisit the all digit dialing controversy and see how heated the debate was heated enough to inspire a stan freberg satirical song they took away our murray hills the 1962 telephone directory lists nearly 400 letter number combinations used in the city from ac academy 2 to yu yukon 8 among the most memorable combinations were butterfield 8 thanks to the 1960 movie of that name won elizabeth taylor a best actress oscar and pennsylvania 6 which was immortalized in a glenn miller song pennsylvania 6 5000 as the phone number of the hotel pennsylvania at seventh avenue and 33rd street in fact it is still their number and you can hear the tune when you dial it if you ca n't get enough of this topic you may want to investigate the telephone exchange name project web site at http   ourwebhomecom tenp tenprojecthtml george robinson fyi e mail fyi nytimescom

as soon as the first reports of a plane crash near kennedy airport in queens commandeered television screens yesterday morning some stations quietly removed the red white and blue logos and american flags from their broadcasts any suggestion even a subliminal one that this airplane disaster was a continuation of the terrorist attacks of sept 11 could seem premature television journalists are not always known for caution and restraint when reporting breaking news but yesterday anchors repeatedly emphasized that it was wrong to speculate about the cause of a plane crash two months and a day after hijacked planes plowed into the world trade center and the pentagon the urge to reassure and inform with care were at times clashing impulses as maurice dubois an anchor at wnbc put it shortly before 10 am it does not appear to be related to terrorism but obviously we can not say that just yet as americans once again clustered around television sets yesterday 's national and local television coverage of the crash showed all too familiar images of screeching firetrucks black smoke and stricken onlookers it also provided a clearer than usual look at the competitive scramble to cover breaking news wabc tv news the new york abc affiliate was the first to broadcast footage of the fire raging in belle harbor because a part time employee happened to live in rockaway park and heard the plane crash a few blocks from his house but univision the spanish language network relying on reports from the dominican republic was among the first to identify the plane as an airbus not a 767 as other networks had reported and to report that the plane had been headed for santo domingo by midmorning msnbc had ashleigh banfield freshly back from pakistan reporting from queens without any footage of the fire while cnn was interviewing a santo domingo airport spokesman by telephone and other new york stations were interviewing queens witnesses by telephone univision was broadcasting harrowing live footage of victims relatives collapsing in grief at the santo domingo airport the day began with sketchy details looks of shock and caution erik sorenson msnbc 's president removed the flag motif lest it imply that the crash was related to events of sept 11 we did not think that there was any kind of an america against the rest of the world issue with this story mr sorenson said if it turns into that you might see that stars and stripes motif cnn also removed its stars and stripes motif from its banner when news about the crash was sketchiest but put it back later in the afternoon christa robinson a spokeswoman said removing the flag was purely a graphics design decision fox news said its flag motif remained because we 're still at war there were a few early inaccuracies citing city officials statements and wire service reports cnn reported first and like others incorrectly that the airplane was a boeing 767 many news programs made the ominous point that the two hijacked planes that crashed into the towers of world trade center were also 767 's at 9 40 the morning anchor of fox news held aloft a model of a boeing 767 wabc and univision led the pack in correcting the record wabc news was also the first to get a reporter lisa colagrossi to the site for a live standup at 10 22 as she spoke into the camera against a backdrop of firetrucks and police cars wcbs 's jennifer mclogan was phoning in what she could see her location was identified as near the scene within half an hour abc was able to broadcast the fire blazing in belle harbor thanks to kevin cohen an independent videojournalist who often works with wabc tv and lives six blocks from where the plane debris fell i heard a kind of low flying aircraft type sound mr cohen recalled and then i felt a rumbling on the ground i checked to see if my camera was working and got there within 10 minutes cnn which has an arrangement with abc quickly began using the fire footage crediting abc other local news stations including wcbs have their own deals with cnn and also used the footage nbc however does not have a relationship with cnn though it dispatched four trucks and eight reporters wnbc was not able to transmit its own footage because its microwave truck got stuck at police blockades until almost noon wnbc was showing distant images of smoke inset into maps of queens wabc which scheduled a news update during the half time of monday night football stopped showing commercials for much of the day hundreds of people died today and a lot of them are our people new yorkers daniel forman news director of wabc tv explained
the stories are common enough a parent provides a child with a car loan a brother lends a sister money to get by after a layoff or a friend gives another friend start up money for a business a loan here a loan there it all adds up to the tune of 68 billion according to the federal reserve at any given time it says about 71 million person to person loans are outstanding a recent study by the monitor group an investment advisory company in washington tried to analyze the growing person to person loan market the company interviewed 400 adults nationwide late last year and released its results last week it found that roughly 7 percent of all american families were either borrowing or lending money to family or friends the average loan amount is 9600 and the average duration is 18 months only 3 in 10 loans however are ever formalized with written agreements perhaps accounting for a higher than average default rate of around 14 percent still the main benefit of borrowing money from people you know is that it is a lot cheaper than going to a bank eighty eight percent of person to person loans carry no interest and for those that do the average rate is 74 percent the study found that is about half the average rate charged on standard credit cards and personal loans vivian marino

westchester county executive andrew j spano called today for a 1 percent increase in the county sales tax after releasing midyear figures that showed a 328625 shortfall in sales tax revenue the first decline since 1998 westchester officials collected 1161 million from the sale of goods and services during the first half of this year a 03 percent decline from the same period in 2001 mr spano said the tax revenue was expected to continue shrinking even as the county faces much higher costs for state mandated health care programs the news is not good mr spano said the shaky national economy is causing people to spend less and that means we are losing vital sales tax dollars this does not bode well for next year westchester currently has a 675 percent sales tax one of the lowest in the state that rate does not include the cities of mount vernon new rochelle white plains and yonkers which impose their own sales taxes ranging from 775 to 825 percent the proposed increase would not affect those cities which are already at or near the limit of 825 percent set by the state constitution mr spano said the tax increase was more necessary than ever because it would generate an additional 100 million a year for the county of which 75 million would be used to pay for increased costs in state mandated health care programs he said the remaining 25 million would go to local school districts towns and villages to help alleviate their budget problems without the increase mr spano said the county would face a 102 million deficit in the 2003 budget he said the county 's other options would include drastically reducing services like closing parks and cutting day care for low income families and raising property taxes as much as 29 percent or more next year it 's ridiculous that county people should suffer because of having to pay for state programs he said county officials last raised the sales tax in 1991 when they also increased it by 1 percent excluding the cities the county 's share of the 675 percent sales tax is now 25 percentage points in the towns and villages and 15 percentage points in the cities about two thirds of the revenue from the last tax increase is given back to the schools towns and villages the proposed tax increase would require the approval of both the state and county legislatures a half dozen counties including neighboring rockland county have already sought and received approval from the state legislature to increase their sales taxes this year though mr spano and other county officials have approached the westchester delegation of state legislators they have been unable to get its support for raising the tax state assemblyman richard l brodsky a leader of the delegation said the county legislative body as a whole had not requested approval of a tax increase though individuals had come forward to support or oppose it in other counties he said the requests came from the legislatures not the county executive mr brodsky also said he was concerned that the tax increase would be imposed only in some municipalities for the benefit of the entire county it would be like putting a tax just on queens to benefit all of new york city he said susan tolchin chief adviser to mr spano said the proposed increase was no different than the one that had been approved by state legislators in 1991 mr brodsky is simply playing games she said

to the editor regarding the article on athletic fields shortages in westchester fields of dreams may 11 this issue is particularly germane for the byram hills school district in armonk because on june 3 our community will be voting on a 46 million bond to reconstruct and expand physical education and athletic facilities armonk as the article notes has benefited from a relationship with ibm that has added additional field space to our town 's recreation facilities this however has far from resolved issues relating to competing demands for use of our athletic facilities since 1973 when title ix legislation came into effect our school district has more than doubled our number of interscholastic teams at the same time participation in ayso little league and youth lacrosse organizations that all use school district fields as well as the town 's fields at ibm has grown exponentially putting further demand on field space while the ibm fields and strong cooperation between the town of north castle and our schools have alleviated some of the competition for field space in this spring season alone 70 school contests were postponed or canceled because of lack of playable fields when playable the fields are used constantly so they become worn with bare spots and uneven surfaces the bond referendum on june 3 addresses these issues by among other things proposing drainage and irrigation where needed and with the addition of an all weather multipurpose field that can be used intensively for all field sports in virtually all weather conditions wendy gardner president byram hills board of education

capping off a trying year marred by layoffs lawsuits and a tougher consumer market for sodas the coca cola company announced a sharp rebound in fourth quarter earnings yesterday but its sluggish sales raised questions about whether it has enough momentum to accomplish the full turnaround it has pledged for 2001 given coke 's lackluster growth of little more than 1 percent last year in soda sales in the united states the company will have a hard time pulling off the 6 percent to 7 percent gains it has promised wall street analysts said emanuel goldman an analyst with ing barings in san francisco expressed skepticism about whether coke could reach the peak of its estimates to do seven is not exactly like climbing mount everest he said but it is kilimanjaro for the fourth quarter coke 's earnings met analysts expectations which have been tempered by patience over the wholesale revamping that it has just finished with coke now freed from distractions analysts say it needs to return quickly to the type of results that drew investors like children with a sweet tooth for much of the last decade yesterday 's announcement suggested that a reversal in the company 's fortunes may take a little longer than hoped persistent weakness in foreign currencies like the euro the south african rand and the australian dollar caused coke revenues most of which come from outside the united states to fall to 49 billion for the quarter a drop of about 1 percent from 1999 despite the stagnation in sales operating income for the quarter rose to 839 million more than twice what it was in the year before when the company endured a huge write off of its assets in india with fewer such exceptional charges and a somewhat unexpected lift from investments in its bottlers coke 's net income for the quarter reached 242 million compared with a 45 million loss for the similar period the previous year the company met analysts revised earnings expectations of 38 cents a share up from 31 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1999 in trading on the new york stock exchange the value of coke 's stock rose 9 cents a share yesterday to 58 though an improvement over the company 's performance earlier last year the results signaled a slowing of the momentum that coke began to build in the third quarter of 2000 when net income rose 26 percent but by december it became apparent the company 's sales volume a critical measure of how much soft drink makers persuade consumers to buy would rise only 44 percent for the year falling short of the 5 to 6 percent target coke officials steadfastly defended for much of 2000 we almost delivered on that gary fayard coke 's chief financial officer said in a conference call with analysts and reporters yesterday and we did it in the face of restructuring the business putting a new management team in place and settling a discrimination lawsuit eager to put the turmoil of 2000 behind them coke officials said that they would concentrate this year on getting coke in the right place principally through the kind of assertive marketing campaigns that coke was once known for but has been failed to stage in recent years in the last two months coke has turned to a single collection of agencies the interpublic group of companies to bring coherence to what had been a diffuse and often confusing advertising strategy investors have been eagerly anticipating the next wave of commercials hoping it will help end the inertia in soda sales but the beginning of the campaign is still several months away we 're going at 180 miles an hour to get it out there jack l stahl coke 's president said coke officials also said that they would continue to pursue their forays into noncarbonated beverages which grew 11 percent last year more than twice as fast as sales of diet coke and coke around the world given the slowdown in the american economy few coke followers expect to see much improvement in the current quarter but by midyear many anticipate a significant upswing in the tempo of coke 's sales and profits
to the editor enron and the gramms by bob herbert column jan 17 highlights one of many instances where big business has infiltrated the political and regulatory process surely there are countless others besides senator phil gramm and his wife wendy gramm a former government official who have danced to the tune of large corporations the only way to keep this from happening again and innocent working families from losing everything is to keep money out of politics enron and other large companies have been writing checks to politicians to promote their businesses and discourage oversight for years if and when campaign finance reform ever happens and it clearly will not happen under a republican administration politicians can make decisions based on moral grounds instead of on personal and party financial gain emily rosenberg oakland calif jan 17 2002

he never played on the high school varsity he did not play division iii college basketball until he was 24 years old and even now after averaging 272 points a game this season horace jenkins is not widely known beyond the confines of the gym at william paterson university but national basketball association scouts know all about the 26 year old jenkins a 6 foot 1 inch point guard who is extremely quick has a 44 inch vertical leap and can drive the lane or hit from outside with equal facility more than a few nba players and college stars are familiar with jenkins too in the jersey shore summer league duke 's point guard jason williams dueled with jenkins last summer williams perhaps the premier college player at his position was outscored by jenkins 49 30 rick brunson of the knicks faced jenkins in the same league two years ago along with brunson 's summer teammates eddie jones and anthony mason both of the miami heat jenkins brought the crowd to its feet in the tiny st rose high school gym in belmar nj scoring 38 points i did n't know who he was brunson recalled recently but after the game i took him aside and told him 'do n't worry about division iii or anything like that if you 're good enough they 'll find you if you ask me i 'd say yes he can play in the nba he 's got the quickness of allen iverson the shooting ability of stephon marbury and he can dunk on just about anybody he can do it all from what i 've seen if i was a scout he 'd be on my short list many scouts have been following jenkins lately as he and his teammates make their way through the ncaa division iii tournament william paterson 23 4 faces mcmurry university of abilene tex tonight in the round of 16 in newport news va on the day the pioneers began their postseason push last week jenkins received an invitation to attend the portsmouth invitational camp this spring the first of three camps for prospects before the nba draft it means a whole lot jenkins said of the invitation i look at what i went through all my life to get to this point to get this opportunity that i 've always been waiting for and i feel i 'm getting kind of a second chance at life just a few years ago it would have been hard to imagine a less likely candidate for professional basketball either in the nba or in europe jenkins did not play high school ball having coasted through elizabeth high school with just enough effort to graduate but never enough to be eligible to play on the school 's highly regarded team after he played one season of junior college basketball at union county college his grades became a problem his son hakeem was born and he walked away from the game jenkins worked as an electrician and on the back of a garbage truck he had responsibilities to tend to a son to feed and the money he earned was enough to pay the bills and squelch his childhood dreams but he still played ball in the playgrounds after work on the courts at newark 's branch brook park he found the dream once again i played every day and i got criticized from every angle jenkins said there were people telling me 'you 've got too much talent you do n't want to be a neighborhood star it kind of bothered me in a sense i was lost they were giving me constructive criticism but i was working and i was kind of making ends meet i had a son i was trying to be a responsible father then my mother had a long talk with me and i sat and listened and it really helped me realize i never even gave it a shot i walked away from the opportunity that was there the obstacles were easy to see but so was the raw talent jose rebimbas the head coach at william paterson discovered jenkins in branch brook park one summer evening having come to watch muffeed thomas an incoming freshman who had committed to play for the pioneers rebimbas could not take his eyes off the slightly built point guard who was scoring from all angles after watching him play for three quarters i went to muffeed and said 'who 's this kid rebimbas recalled he said 'he 's your starting point guard next year he said that horace really wanted to come so after the game i gave him my business card and said 'listen i hear you 're interested in going to school you 're obviously a wonderful player but i 've been down this road before and i 'm only going to do this if you want to do this while jenkins convinced rebimbas that he truly wanted to play basketball the coach was not easily convinced that jenkins could withstand the rigors of a college classroom or of college basketball even though he was 24 years old this kid was a kid rebimbas said we would n't let 24 hours go by without communicating after tough losses his first year i did n't know how he would be able to deal with it so we 'd talk after good wins we 'd talk i always understood that we had to be there for him to keep pushing him up the ladder that we had set for him jenkins who is as proud of his 27 grade point average as he is of his scoring average is on course to graduate in december if he is drafted or gets the chance to try out for a professional team jenkins said he might postpone his last semester of course work to get that opportunity means so much to me he said of his basketball future because i 've worked so hard to get to this point
to the editor in then there are the poor editorial jan 22 you label workfare as leaf raking jobs that eat up the welfare clock but promise nothing in the way of a career and call it a discredited program while workfare jobs offer little hope of permanent employment or advancement they could offer the dignity of a paying job and a sense of purpose and routine that many find empowering workfare could offer our communities the benefit of inexpensive repair and cleanup think of public parks repaired creek beds cleared of trash graffiti erased weeds cleared fresh paint wherever needed during the depression president franklin d roosevelt 's works progress administration offered jobs ranging from literary and artistic endeavors to construction work in national parks forests and blighted communities few wpa jobs led directly to future employment but most had incalculable value to the lives of thousands of destitute people mark miller los angeles jan 22 2003
a man in a hooded sweatshirt shot and killed a worker in a brooklyn coin laundry yesterday for no apparent reason and detectives have linked the slaying to three other unprovoked killings at businesses in brooklyn and queens in the past month a police official said ballistic evidence connects the weapon used to kill the worker albert kotlyar 32 a russian emigre who was preparing to enlist in the united states armed forces with the fatal shootings of two immigrant shopkeepers on feb 8 a different gun was used in another killing on march 1 but the police have said they believed it was also connected based on its timing and the description of the suspects the shootings all occurred in the morning and in each case the gunman shot his victim in the head and took little or no money also in each case the police say the gunman has killed even though he encountered little or no resistance from his targets yesterday 's shooting at 6 am at the 24 hour brightly lit laundry king superstore at 1384 atlantic avenue in bedford stuyvesant was similar in its apparent lack of motive the police said in front of two customers the gunman wearing a dark three quarter length coat over a hooded sweatshirt had a brief exchange of words with mr kotlyar who was behind the counter then he raised his right arm and fired hitting mr kotlyar just under the chin from about five feet away a senior police official said nothing was taken from the laundry the official said this guy comes into the place with a coffee cup and he goes and sits down in the laundromat and walks back to the bathroom and comes out and shoots the guy just shoots him a second police official said describing the scene captured on the store 's security video it seems to me there is a nut out there a calculating one too a cousin of mr kotlyar 's said the police had told him that the gunman had sat in the laundry for two hours before the slaying chief of detectives george f brown has formed a task force of 20 detectives headed by deputy inspector vito spano who normally serves as commander of the cold case squad to hunt down the suspect the senior police official said the police had not yet determined last night who placed the 911 call that brought emergency workers to the scene to find mr kotlyar dead the police said that ballistics tests showed that the same 40 caliber revolver was used on feb 8 to kill john freddy 43 as he tried to buy a cup of coffee at the central mini market on liberty avenue in ozone park queens in that shooting there were two gunmen after an unsuccessful attempt to open the cash register the gunmen left with no money an investigator said the suspected killer was shown on a security camera video wearing a dkny coat over a hooded sweatshirt two hours later at the around the clock mini mart a deli in mill basin brooklyn sukhjit khajala the cashier was killed again with the same revolver the police said again there were two men and the robbers made off with 169 and on march 1 two robbers shot marc zanichelli the manager of an auto parts store in east new york brooklyn after he told them he did not have a key to the safe they got away with the wallets of a few employees in that shooting a 45 caliber handgun was used the police said all four shootings took place between 6 and 9 30 am and until yesterday 's all occurred on saturdays yesterday the gunman acted alone mr kotlyar whose family came to the united states from russia 24 years ago had been on the brink of signing up to fight in the potential war in iraq his relatives said he wanted to join the marines and i was afraid to let him said his mother lyudmila kotlyar she said that her son did not normally work at night but had switched shifts with a co worker he had been working at the laundry for only a month before that he worked at a family business a dry cleaner 's on the upper east side mr kotlyar 's father paul cares for elderly people as a home aide mrs kotlyar said early in the day before the ballistic test results came back investigators went about their routine of trying to determine whether mr kotlyar had had any gambling debts or drug connections but his family described him as a quiet homebody who lived in midwood brooklyn with his parents and 25 year old sister and spent much of his time playing computer games and carving dragons and other fantasies from wood he was one of those sci fi guys said dimitry berger a cousin mr berger 's father viktor berger said nobody wanted to kill albert this is ridiculous he is harmless reached by phone two hours after she received the news that her son was dead mrs kotlyar was so distraught that she misspelled her own name and had to correct herself correction march 13 2003 thursday a picture caption yesterday with an article about a series of unsolved killings at small businesses gave an incorrect spelling in some copies for the name of the worker killed at a market in mill basin brooklyn he was sukhjit khajala not sukhgit khagala a map on tuesday with an article about the case misstated the address of the laundry king superstore in bedford stuyvesant brooklyn where the latest victim was killed it is 1392

for young children especially at this length the love story will bore them to tears and they are n't the only ones ages 12 and up like doolittle they should make it through the animal rob schneider colleen haskell john c mcginley guy torry edward asner directed by luke greenfield pg 13 83 minutes a hapless police clerk named marvin mr schneider flies off not one cliff but three in a single automobile accident normally that would spell finito but what 's left of him is dragged off by a mad professor and restored by using animal parts now in addition to being the sweet mannered butt of everyone 's abuse marvin is part dog and mountain lion he can also outrun a horse sniff out heroin at the airport and swim like a dolphin all of this dovetails with rianna ms haskell of survivor television show fame who runs an animal shelter and would make love to trees if she could rianna seems taken with marvin 's combination of simpering submissiveness and more assertive characteristics you are an animal she says after they have sex off screen marvin however noses for bones in trash barrels and retreats to the men 's room to trumpet like an elephant when creatures are mysteriously done away with the town organizes a beast witch hunt violence some threatening moves but this is clearly farce sex many references and implications particularly for a movie that will attract young children specific sex acts are referred to by name furthermore marvin has trouble controlling his urges around animals and makes a pass at a goat it 's all part of the gag of course but it is laid on heavily profanity a fair amount footnote marvin has a black friend mr torry who observes that white people routinely excuse black people for bad behavior which to him is a kind of reverse discrimination for which children under age 11 the sex will rule it out for many parents ages 11 and up should n't be a problem what 's the worst that could happen martin lawrence danny devito john leguizamo carmen ejogo glenne headly nora dunn directed by sam weisman pg 13 98 minutes when the media mogul max fairbanks mr devito catches the burglar kevin caffery mr lawrence rifling his beach mansion they start vying over a ring they consider lucky it gets involved but kevin 's girlfriend amber ms ejogo gave him the ring and max 's staff psychic ms headly tells him it will bring smooth sailing as arrogant as they come max is under investigation for owning too many television stations encountering financial speed bumps he is advised to file for bankruptcy which focuses attention on his mansion and its contents as well as expensive items in his boston town house all that loot lures kevin and his assistant berger mr leguizamo who burglarize both places little max does n't care about that or much else either having bribed all the senators and judges he needs he has few concerns about his ultimate welfare but he 'll fight for that ring which bears his company 's logo and remains lodged on his chubby finger despite kevin 's every effort to yank it off maybe these two should team up violence some jokey robbery rough and tumble with a few shots fired but no one gets hurt sex there is plenty of the pg 13 variety which means no action but a lot of references and situations kevin and amber are lovers max has a girl in every mansion unabashedly regards and discusses their anatomies concealed by bubble bath and the like and seems to expect sex from any woman he encounters profanity strong obscenities for which children under age 11 for many sex and profanity will earn a parental veto ages 11 and up mr lawrence is a draw in a tolerable comedy

to the editor in this 30th anniversary of congressional passage of title ix the civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in education it is ironic and discouraging that the bush administration has chosen to use its regulatory power to encourage sex discrimination by promoting single sex education news article may 9 instead schools need federal support to make the kind of changes envisioned by title ix and by the women 's educational equity act of 1974 to transform their classrooms and playing fields to ensure that boys and girls grow up and learn as equals if it is true that girls must be segregated from boys to build their self confidence and learn math and science that should tell us that something is deeply wrong with our classrooms our curriculums and our teaching methods rather than with girls and boys leslie r wolfe president center for women policy studies washington may 10 2002

to the editor students carry heavy loads in their backpacks because american textbooks are too thick and cover too many topics without exploring the material in sufficient depth education page feb 16 in some foreign countries schools teach less material but cover the topics in greater depth as a result their textbooks are shorter and lighter even so students tend to get higher scores on standardized tests than american students perhaps with shorter textbooks and classes that cover topics in greater depth our students would suffer fewer back problems they might also have higher test scores julie statius muller rye ny feb 17 2000

when casting donizetti 's opera maria stuarda it 's ideal to find two sopranos of different vocal styles and temperaments to portray the two british queens whose rivalry dominates the story the title character mary stuart queen of scots and elisabetta queen elizabeth i the conductor eve queler accomplished this and then some with the performance she conducted on sunday night at carnegie hall with the opera orchestra of new york ruth ann swenson sang maria and lauren flanigan sang elisabetta both are great sopranos but in totally different ways the performance was a testimony to the stylistic and interpretive variety that is possible in bel canto opera ms swenson was in sumptuous voice she may lack some degree of intensity but for sheer beauty of sound and purity of tone she can not be topped from her first entrance when the imprisoned queen sings a wistful cavatina about freedom ms swenson 's singing was ravishingly tender lyrically pliant and luscious she could render a service to opera by going from conservatory to conservatory and letting young singers clasp their hands about her diaphragm as she sings for a demonstration of perfect breath support as always ms swenson 's sound especially in her floated sustained high range singing resonated throughout the hall without a trace of effort as elisabetta ms flanigan wore the visceral effort of singing as a badge of honor true to form she was a fierce impassioned life force tearing through the coloratura passagework leaping to high notes with hellbent determination making pretty sounds was not her intention and some of her singing was rough and wobbly yet there was a different kind of beauty earthy and raw in her work ms queler was content to stay out of the way and simply provide a supportive orchestral backdrop for her two prima donnas the tenor gregory kunde made a vocally reliable and earnest leicester the hapless man in the middle of the regal showdown the sturdy bass baritone patrick carfizzi was talbot the warm voiced mezzo soprano eleni matas was maria 's nurse anna and the promising baritone chang yong liao made his opera orchestra debut as elisabetta 's scheming lord cecil the program contained an insert with personal tributes from numerous musicians to henry schuman the orchestra 's longtime principal oboist who played in the rehearsals on monday and tuesday of last week then died of a heart attack last wednesday
